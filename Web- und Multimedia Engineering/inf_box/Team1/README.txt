The /home folder contains all files related to the website. 

Inside you will find:

index.html	: the main webpage html file
img/		: all images needed for the website (thumbnails and logo)
resources/	: folder with all other resources needed for the webpage (e.i. font awesome, html5 reset stylesheet, the stylesheet for out webpage: styles.css, jquery.js)

The javascript has been split into two parts:
/home/resources/inf_box-Script.js:
contains all the main functionality of our web page
/home/resources/inf_box-util.js:
contains functions programmed specifically for this web page but that could easily be reused for other web pages

Note: at the moment we added a temporal button to the login form to be able to load user content dynamically. One can type an existing user's username in the login form and click "load user" to display this user's content
Once the server to process the request is live, this button would dissappear and the login validation would happen in the server

Files to be graded:

/home/index.html
/home/resources/styles.css
/home/resources/inf_box-Script.js
/home/resources/inf_box-util.js

Known bugs: 
even though the source for the audio and video previews is set correctly, the content is not displayed inside the player
